## Introduction

Internally, we mostly use [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

Our applications usually provide a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API with [GraphQL Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/w) in order to allow communication with other applications.

To test our applications we implement TDD, using [RSpec](https://rspec.info/).

It's a great idea to read & follow these guides before continuing:
