# The Geek Manifest

- No code is better than no code (if I didn't know how to program, how would I solve it?);
- Delivered is when we can prove that the customer received value in production;
  - Customer used;
  - We collect usage behavior, we prove it works;
  - We monitor bugs and performance issues to make sure it's done right;
- TDD is an implicit requirement of any code intervention;
- The sprint is always the guide, tasks outside of it should be the exception (‚ÄúTop! Tell Vivi to prioritize for us!‚Äù)
- Refactoring code is important, but the focus always needs to be on the task
  - fixing code outside of it can generate value but can compromise your schedule related to what you expected to deliver initially.
- Start double, deliver solo (always open tasks in pair, building the test scenario until the problem is clear to be played in solo mode.
  - In this way, ensuring that the planning is ‚Äúreal‚Äù or correcting the same);
  
- When the brain gives Timeout, raise HelpException;
