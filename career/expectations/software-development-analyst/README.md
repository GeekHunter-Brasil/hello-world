# üßë‚Äçüíª  Software Development Analyst

A software development analyst has one purpose at GeekHunter: create value to both Geekers and users by applying their solving problems skills (mostly) through technology.

Thus, a software development analyst is usually assigned into a product squad (with a well defined purpose) and is responsible for the value delivery of our product.

It's not expected, neither encouraged, that a software development analyst works "alone", but that can happen in edge cases - so autonomy and self management are important skills to develop.

Usually, this person will be working within a squad along with 2 ~ 3 other developers, data scientists, product designers, product managers, etc.


# Expectations

What do we expect from a software development analyst at GeekHunter?


## üê£ Junior Software Development Analyst

### Experience

- **Usually goes with the current hype.** Always wants to try out new frameworks or languages but doesn't know how to balance this with the daily routine. Usually, this ends up hurting the productivity for themselves or the team.
- Knows at least a bit about software development (a few months to one year of experience), preferably in production environment. Has already worked in new features, bugfixes, etc.
- Knows at least a bit about agile culture. Has a slight idea of key practices such as Scrum or Kanban.
- Does not review code from other collaborators. Finds it difficult to analyze external code and to find problems in it.
- Asks for help whenever they are feeling blocked, not productive or doesn't know what to do.
- Usually codes "by example" (e.g. copying code), and **does not understand how that code works**.
- Gets blocked often, requiring more attention and support.
- Is not proactive with new tasks. Usually needs someone else to tell them what to do.

### Hard Skills

- **Knows at least a bit of the tech stack that we use** (Ruby on Rails, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Python, GraphQL, etc). Will eventually get blocked and have questions on how to build software using those technologies.
- Knows at least a bit about automated tests, and at least understands their importance. Is capable of writing a test with the help of another developer.
- Usually has a difficult time to write code that respects our [Styleguide](https://github.com/GeekHunter-Brasil/hello-world).
- Usually can't do TDD on a daily basis, but knows what it is.
- Knows at least a bit about git, but can't follow processes such as gitflow.
- Doesn't know much about database technologies, and usually has a hard time writing a SQL query.
- Knows about Object-Oriented Programming, but has difficulty implementing it daily.
- Usually **doesn't know much about software design**. Has a hard time following patterns (e.g. clean or hexagonal architecture).
- Doesn't know how to architect an application according to its needs (a monolith, micro-services, serveless, etc). **Usually tries to implement a complex model where it's not needed and ends up hurting productivity**.
- **Doesn't know how to debug code**. Usually has a difficult time trying to understand why something doesn't work.

### Soft Skills

- Is able to keep their presence in synchronous moments (e.g. squad rituals such as dailies, plannings, reviews; pair programming sessions) and asynchronous ones (e.g. discussions on Slack, JIRA, Basecamp, etc).
- Is really motivated to learn more and develop their skills.
- Usually doesn't understand their own strengths and weaknesses, or how to advance in their career. Needs an active leadership helping them to progress.

## üê§ Mid-level Software Development Analyst

### Experience

- **Adds value to the team**. Is capable of delivering their work efficiently, without being blocked too often.
- Has development experience in production software. This includes creating new features, fixing bugs (sometimes hotfixes üßØüî•), and refactoring code.

- **Does review other people's codes via a code review process**. Points out problems and improvements.
- Asks for help whenever they are feeling blocked, unproductive or doesn't know what to do.
- Usually codes "by example" (e.g. copying code), **but knows what they are doing and is usually capable of learning on the fly**.
- Knows a bit about continuous delivery and continous integration and why those are important, but **often creates PRs that are hard to review and to ship efficiently**.
- Is proactive about starting new tasks. Usually does not need someone else to tell them what to do, as long as there are tasks that conform to a DoR (Definition of Ready).

### Hard Skills

- **Is experienced in most of the tech stack that we use** (Ruby on Rails, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Python, GraphQL, etc). May have occasional blocks, but is able to develop efficiently.
- **Uses TDD on a daily basis, and understands the importance of it**.
- Writes code according to our [Styleguide](https://github.com/GeekHunter-Brasil/hello-world).
- Has experience with common database technologies. Knows relational models, tables, views, indices, and other terms. Writes performant SQL queries.
- Has experience in git, and **is able to resolve merge conflicts**.
- Is fluent in Object-Oriented Programming. Knows the key points to it and writes high-quality OOP code.
- Knows what Functional Programming is. Knows advantages and disadvantages to each paradigm.
- Understands concepts such as data immutability, pure functions, and reactivity.
- **Understands concepts about software design, and knows how to follow common patterns** such as Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture and others. Knows about their advantages and disadvantages.
- Understands how to architect applications and is capable of choosing a good architecture according to the complexity and challenge (e.g. monoliths, micro-services, serveless, etc).
- **Knows how to debug code**. Is capable of debugging their own code, manipulating memory and instructions to reproduce a specific context.
- Is usually capable of debugging external code (such as a project dependency). For instance, is capable of creating a fork from an external repository along with a PR fixing a bug, in case a dependency stops working.
- Is capable of solving any problem that doesn't involve R&D (Research & Development) efficiently.

### Soft Skills

- Is able to keep their presence in synchronous moments (e.g. squad rituals such as dailies, plannings, reviews; pair programming sessions) and asynchronous ones (e.g. discussions on Slack, JIRA, Basecamp, etc).
- Is really motivated to learn more and develop their skills.
- Usually understands their own strengths and weaknesses, and sees something they want to prioritize in their career. The leadership process here is usually easier, since this person is able to develop their skills with some level of autonomy.
- Has emotional resilience to go through challenging scenarios and is able to receive valuable feedbacks and use them to improve.

## üêì Senior Software Development Analyst

### Experience

- **Multiplies value on the team**. Delivers their work efficiently, but there is a key difference here: this person looks at the team's productivity, suggesting improvements and using their experience to multiply our overall productivity.
- Has a solid experience in software development for a considerable time (e.g. more than five years) in production, preferably having worked with critical software where it's really expensive to be offline.
