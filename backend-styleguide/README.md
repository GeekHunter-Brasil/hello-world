# üé® Backend Style Guide

Welcome to our backend style guide! Grab your cup of coffee (or tea) and read this with attention. ‚òïüçµ

The goal of this guide is to help our team to understand and follow our code style and best practices, maintaining a pattern in all repositories.

## Introduction

Internally, we mostly use [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

Our applications usually provide a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API with [GraphQL Ruby](https://graphql-ruby.org/w) in order to allow communication with other applications.

To test our applications we implement TDD, using [RSpec](https://rspec.info/).

It's a great idea to read & follow these guides before continuing:

- [Rails Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- [Learn Ruby on Rails - Full Course, by FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg)
- [Getting started with RSpec](https://rspec.info/)

## Organization

We follow the standard Rails file organization pattern with a few tweaks, to organize our service and domains.

It's a great idea to read these posts to get started with the basics:

- [Ruby on Rails - Directory Structure](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm)
- [Folder structure in Ruby on Rails](https://dev-yakuza.posstree.com/en/ruby-on-rails/folder-structure/)

## Application Layers

We usually break down our application between multiple layers. Here are some great reads that are recommended before continuing:

- [Clean Architecture - A Little Introduction](https://medium.com/swlh/clean-architecture-a-little-introduction-be3eac94c5d1)
- [DDD for Rails Developers. Part 1: Layered Architecture](https://www.sitepoint.com/ddd-for-rails-developers-part-1-layered-architecture/)

Here's a quick summary of some important points:

### Controllers

Controllers should only care how to parse & format requests and responses. They should not hold any application logic, instead calling services or other resources to do the job.

‚ùå Bad
```ruby
def sell_book
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])

  if book.sold?
    book.errors.add :base, "The book is already sold"
  else
    book.sell
  end
end
```

‚úÖ Good
```ruby
def sell_book
  @book = Book.find(params[:id])
  BookSellingService.sell_book(@book)
end
```

### Services

We use services to extract and isolate business rules within our problem domain. This is a great idea since it becomes much easier to test each service and rule.

When dealing with complex rules, it's a great idea to break it down between multiple services and then create one manager service to execute the flow.

Here's a snippet explaining how to break down multiple services, taking the flow of creating a new hiring as an example:

‚úÖ Good
```ruby
module Services::Hirings::HiringManagerCreator
  def flow(params)
    prepared_params = prepare_params(params)
    hiring = hiring_creator.create(prepared_params)

    update_company(params)

    send_email_to_candidate(params)
    send_email_to_company(params)
    send_email_to_admin(params)
    track_conversion(params)

    hiring
  end

  private

  def prepare_params(params)
    # Implementation goes here
  end

  def update_company(params)
    # Implementation goes here
  end

  def send_email_to_candidate(params)
    # Implementation goes here
  end

  def send_email_to_company(params)
    # Implementation goes here
  end

  def send_email_to_admin(params)
    # Implementation goes here
  end

  def track_conversion(params)
    # Implementation goes here
  end

  def hiring_creator
    # Notice that this is another service that deals only with creating the record,
    # since there are more rules & validations to be done there.
    @hiring_creator ||= ::Services::Hirings::Create::HiringCreator.new
  end
end
```
