  Frontend Style Guide
</h2>

Welcome to our frontend style guide!

Grab your cup of coffee (or tea) and read this with attention. ☕🍵

## Intro

The goal of this guide is to help our team to understand and follow our code style and best practices, maintaining a pattern in all repositories.

We also use the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as a base, so it is **highly recommended** reading it before you continue.
