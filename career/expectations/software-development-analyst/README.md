# üßë‚Äçüíª  Software Development Analyst

A software development analyst usually has one purpose at GeekHunter: to solve problems (mostly) using technology and to use their skills to help our collaborators
and users in their daily routine.

Thus, a software development analyst is usually assigned into a squad (with a well defined purpose) and is responsible for value delivery in ou product.

It's not expected that a software development analyst will work "alone", but that can happen in extreme cases - so autonomy and self management are important skills. Usually,
this person will be working in a squad with 2 ~ 3 other developers, data scientists, product designers, etc.


# Expectations

What do we expect from a software development analyst at GeekHunter?


## üê£ Junior Software Development Analyst

### Experience

- **Usually goes with the current hype.** Always wants to try out new frameworks or languages but doesn't know how to balance this with the daily routine. Usually, this ends up hurting the productivity for himself or the team.
- Knows at least a bit about software development (a few months to one year), preferably in production environments. Has already worked in new features, bugfixes, etc.
- Knows at least a bit about agile culture, has a slight idea of what are key terms such as Scrum or Kanban
- Does not review code for other collaborators. Usually finds it difficult to analyze external code and find problems in it.
- Is able to identify whenever is blocked, not being productive or knowing what to do next. Asks for help in these cases.
- Usually codes "by example" (e.g. copying code), **does not understand how that code works**.
- Requires more attention, since usually gets blocked often.
- Is not proactive with new tasks. Usually needs someone else to tell them what to do.
