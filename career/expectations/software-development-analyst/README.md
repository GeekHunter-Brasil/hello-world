# 🧑‍💻  Software Development Analyst

A software development analyst usually has one purpose at GeekHunter: to solve problems (mostly) using technology and to use their skills to help our collaborators
and users in their daily routine.

Thus, a software development analyst is usually assigned into a squad (with a well defined purpose) and is responsible for value delivery in ou product.

It's not expected that a software development analyst will work "alone", but that can happen in extreme cases - so autonomy and self management are important skills. Usually,
this person will be working in a squad with 2 ~ 3 other developers, data scientists, product designers, etc.
