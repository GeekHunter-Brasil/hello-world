# ‚ôæÔ∏è The Geek Testing Style Guide

Welcome to our testing style guide!

The goal of this guide is to help our team to think about tests, write them, and review someone else's code taking them into account.

## Introduction

<img alt="no-test-no-beer" src="/docs/no-test-no-beer.jpg" width="200">
Software testing is a very important aspect of our daily job at Geek: it's fundamental to our goal of delivering high-value products through high-quality software.

There're many arguments on why to test software. We highlight a few:

- good test strategies are KEY to increase codebase quality overtime; and a high-quality codebase is KEY to a high-quality product
- a good set of practices DECREASES cognitive effort in write/review phases; and less effort in write/review BUYS us time and energy to focus on delivering value to customers
- test is cheaper than bugfix; and SCALES better
- meaningful testing ENCOURAGES us to think about useful design patterns

## Concepts

We have a few concepts with which we should be familiar. Things like test pyramid, test doubles, black-box vs white-box testing, and so on. We highly recommend you carefully read this [introductory article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) before moving on. It talks about different types of tests and how they fit in the analogy of the test pyramid.

[Back to top ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#pushpin-summary)

## Strategies

We lay down here some strategies that we adopt at Geek and to which we pay great attention. Fundamentally, they guide us while we write tests.

### TDD

Quoting the Geek Manifest:

`"TDD is an implicit requirement of any code intervention"`

We can even say Test Driven Development is more than just a requirement: it is a way of thinking our software. On the more granular level of black-box testing, we first write our specification file that describes how a piece of code should behave, i.e the functionality we expect from it. Then, we move to the next phase of writing the code to implement it. It requires a good understanding of our design patterns, our dependency chain, the programming paradigm we are using (OOP for most part), and specificities of the frameworks we adopt. All of that beforehand. Besides, we always have choices to make when it comes to whether or not we mock dependencies. On the practical sections, we will see examples of how to do it in our stack and what kind of choices made sense for us. Those choices translated to a guideline that we at Geek follow when writing our tests.

Also, it's worth noting that doing TDD helps building the basis of our test pyramid: if for every piece of code we write we have an underlying test to support it, the basis of the pyramid will increase effortlessly.

> TDD it's not about just changing the order of write-code vs write-test, it about changing how we code. It works by forcing us to think "how are we gonna test this?" before thinking "how are we gonna make this work?". So writing the test JUST after you wrote the code it's not a little difference, it's a big difference and it's not even close to doing TDD. TDD is not always the best way to develop something, sometimes you just want to write an experiment to discover or research something, and this is fine. Just don't lie to yourself that you are doing TDD when you're obviously not.

Next are some practices we believe are good to follow while writing tests with TDD:

- **Test Isolation:** one test should never affect other test. If I have one test broken, I have one problem. If I have two tests broken, I have two problems. This also implies that the tests are order independent.
- **Assert First:** start writing the tests with assertions that will pass when it is done. Always try to answer these two questions: "What is the right answer?" and "How am I going to check for the right answer?"
- **Evident Data:** How do you represent the intent of the data? Include expected and actual results in the text itself, and try to make their relationship apparent. You are writing tests for a reader, not just for the computer.
- **Take a Break:** What do you do when you feel tired or stuck? Take a break. And if you still feel this way after the break, than raise HelpException, or, in other words, call for help üòâ.

If you want to learn more about TDD, we strongly recommend you to take a look in these two books:

- [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B095SQ9WP4/?coliid=I3VU9HPFYLWNXJ&colid=U42P2DJ549XI&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it), from Kent Beck (aka the Father of TDD) where he builds from sketch a Money API showing all the steps and paths that you take by doing TDD the right way.
- [Effective Testing with Rspec 3: Build Ruby Apps with Confidence](https://www.amazon.com.br/Effective-Testing-RSpec-Myron-Marston/dp/1680501984/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3QGCORSGDQ4OV&keywords=effective+testing+with+rspec+3&qid=1662209082&sprefix=effective+testing+with+rspec+3%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.6d798eae-cadf-45de-946a-f477d47705b9) from Myron Marston and Ian Dees. In this book you will learn how to use the power of rspec combined with TDD to create tests that truly reflects your app behavior.

### BDD

Behavior Driven Design fills the void we sometimes have between the acceptance criteria of a given task and the expectations we write for our code. In BDD, when building the specifications, we use a user-driven language (usually supported by a DSL) that connects the test scenarios with the product need. Therefore, doing BDD requires we think about tests from the very beginning, i.e from the refinement phase of a user story.

On the practical sections, we will see examples of implementing BDD for a sample task. Check out [this post](https://blog.geekhunter.com.br/a-juncao-do-behavior-driven-development-e-metodologia-agil/#:~:text=BDD%20%C3%A9%20uma%20metodologia%20de,e%20%E2%80%9Ccrit%C3%A9rios%20de%20aceita%C3%A7%C3%A3o%E2%80%9D) in our blog for a very good article on the role of BDD in Agile Culture.

### Do not reimplement logic

When writing black-box testing, make sure not to reimplement logic. If we are doing classic TDD, the chances of reimplementing logic are dramatically reduced since we start first with the specification and then we move to the implementation.

However, we often have to cope with legacy code that is not tested. In those cases, pay attention to write your test without mimicking the logic itself. Another situation where we can be tempted to reimplement logic is when we decide to mock our dependencies. While writing our test doubles, we are necessarily thinking on the implementation already. In those cases, make sure not to test the doubles themselves.

Take a look [at this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W40mpZP9xQQ&t=918s) that addresses this and other common mistakes when doing TDD.

### Non-decreasing Code Coverage

In order to increase code quality overtime, it's very useful to enforce a non-decreasing policy in our CI/CD pipelines. With that in mind, we don't allow code to be merged in the main branches if the overall code coverage decreases. Additionally, we look at the branches coverage as the criteria taken into account as it helps us focus on non trivial code we want to test instead of enforcing a 100% line coverage. Therefore, make sure you cover all possible code paths in your specification file.

It's worth noting that too many code paths to cover may indicate a method that can be simplified and broken down. Take a look at [this definition](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/cyclomatic-complexity) to help guide on that regard and at [this introduction](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage) to code coverage as well.

### Do not refactor code unless tested

By refactoring, we mean the act of changing the implementation of a subject without changing its external behavior/functionality. Therefore, by definition, any black-box testing that is written for that entity should continue to pass. That means we can, and should, see tests as a guardrail that will prevent us from making mistakes during refactoring.

Therefore, do not refactor code unless tested; otherwise you risk introducing bugs to the codebase that may not be caught by someone else in a Code Review.

[Back to top ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](#pushpin-summary)

### Use and Abuse from RSpec Syntax

Notice that when we use the Rspec DSL for testing (`describe, context, it`) we want to tell a story:

- (describe) `MyClass`;
- (describe) `'#my_instance_method'`;
- (context) `when 'called with no params'`;
- (it) `'raises a validation exception'`;
- (describe) `'.my_class_method'`;
- (context) `'when called with float'`;
- (it) `'raises a must provide Decimal exception'`;

By convention instance methods have the `#` prefix, and class methods the `.` prefix. This makes it easy to learn about the code while reading the tests.
You can dig this up on the `rspec-core` documentation: https://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core

We don't use `it 'should do something'`, instead we use `it 'does something'`.

![Do or do not, there is no should.](https://i.imgflip.com/6kupo6.jpg)

## In practice: Rails

Sometimes we find ourselves dealing with some complex domain logic (such as hiring a candidate). To make our life easier, in these scenarios, we tend to split our problem in some layers:

1. Entrypoint: controllers, mutations, workers, etc
2. Manager: the point of truth, where we handle all the business rule
3. Service: code that we think that is a good idea to concentrate in one place
4. Validator: where we validate the input data
5. Repository: where we communicate with the database

With this approach, we make our application more manageable with well defined responsibilities to each abstraction. Besides, and not by chance, this simplifies the task of writing tests in different granularity.

> **A very important note here: we don't always structure our code in these five layers, because, when we are doing TDD the right way, we don't mind how we are going to implement some feature, but how we are going to TEST it. We end up, for example, writing and implementing the feature directly in the Controller.**
>
> **Finished the tests, we are able to refactor it and decide how we want to do it. Sometimes we want to split the feature in all these five layers, sometimes we don't feel the need to create a manager, and so on. There is not right or wrong, the most important thing is to write code that are covered by tests and easy to refactor it**

With that been said, we can go with the guideline for how we usually write the tests in each one of those layers.

### üì® Entrypoint Layer

Here is where our Controllers, Mutations, Workers, Rakes and so on, are defined. For this layer, we want an integration test going all the way to the database and external APIs. In each integration test, we find useful to test side effect and the response itself. With that in mind, two main things are asserted in an entrypoint test:

- That the input is correctly handled (e.g. that an ActiveRecord attribute is correctly updated at the database level)
- That the response is the expected (e.g. response.body, response.status, etc)

Here we want to hit a testing database with a set of transactions, and assert changes in the ActiveRecord itself. In addition to that, external APIs can be mocked with their expect behavior for a given scenario (we use [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) to handle this cases)

Let's use a Controller that handles a Hiring creation as example and go with the happy path, expecting that the hiring was created and the response status is 201.

```ruby
describe HiringsController, type: :request do
  context 'when hiring a candidate' do
    # Use FactoryBot.create to create an instance of your data object and persist it to the testing database
    let(:candidate_to_hire) { create(:candidate) }
    let(:job_to_hire_for) { create(:job) }
    let(:params) do
      {
        candidate_id: candidate_to_hire.id,
        job_id: job_to_hire_for.id
      }
    end
    let(:hire_a_candidate) do
      post 'hiring', params: params
    end

    it 'creates a new hiring' do
      # Assert if the hiring was created
      expect { hire_a_candidate }.to change(Hiring, :count).from(0).to(1)
    end

    it 'returns status code 201' do
      hire_a_candidate

      # Assert response code is 201
      expect(response).to have_http_status(201)
    end
  end
end
```

#### üéõÔ∏è Manager & Service Layers

The Manager layer is the source of truth when talking about business rules, being responsible to concentrate all the code required to complete a certain action or behavior (e.g. hire a candidate). Usually, the Manager is called at the Entrypoint Layer, but sometimes, one manager needs to call another one, and that's totally fine.

On the other hand, Services are like Managers, but much simpler. They follow the Single Responsibility rule. Typically the create a new Service in two scenarios: the code regarding some responsibility it's too big that we extract to a different class or the code could be shared and used in other places of the application. Such as Managers, Services can call other Services.

Since we only create these files in the REFACTOR step of TDD, the business rule is already tested, so we DO NOT ALWAYS create tests for them. Usually, if we feel the need to create tests specific for a manager or service (for example, the manager has some `prepared_params` method that has a high cyclomatic complexity) we tend to use unit tests to help us quickly and reliably test more scenarios and edge cases than we do at an entrypoint layer.

So we don't necessarily test everything, and assuming other parts of the application are also tested (they should be!), it becomes much easier to simply spy the dependencies and assert how the code is communicating with them (mock roles, not objects).

> Write tests until the fear is transformed into boredom

Following our example, let's assume the manager responsible for hire a candidate has two dependencies: `hiring_repo` and `candidate_mailer`. Also, the `prepared_params` method has some different paths that the code could follow and the result from it is passed to the `hiring_repo`.

Therefore, we want to assert how the manager is communicating with their dependencies.

`services/companies/hiring_manager_creator.rb`

```ruby
module Services
  module Companies
    module Hirings
      class HiringManagerCreator

        attr_reader :hiring_repo, :candidate_mailer

        def initialize(hiring_repo:, candidate_mailer:)
          @hiring_repo = hiring_repo
          @candidate_mailer = candidate_mailer
        end

        def create(params, company)
          prepared_params = prepare_params(params, company)

          created_hiring = @hiring_repo.create(prepared_params)

          ...
          ...
          ...

          @candidate_mailer.send_hired_mail(prepared_params(:candidate_email)) if company.automatic_approve_hiring

          ...
          ...
          ...

          created_hiring
        end

        private

        def prepare_params(params, company)
          if company.automatic_approve_hiring
            params[:status] = Hiring.status.approved
            params[:approve_source] = Hiring.approve_source.auto
          else
            params[:status] = Hiring.status.waiting_approval
          end

          params[:should_discount_from_package] = company.company_package.type != CompanyPackage.type.unlimited

          ...
          ...
          ...

          params
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

`spec/services/companies/hirings/hiring_manager_creator_spec.rb`

```ruby
describe Services::Companies::HiringManagerCreator, type: :service do
  # Use FactoryBot.build_stubbed to generate your data
  let(:candidate) { build_stubbed(:candidate) }
  let(:job) { build_stubbed(:job) }
  let(:params) do
    {
      candidate_id: candidate.id,
      job_id: job.id,

  end

  let(:hiring_repo_spy) { spy Repositories::Hiring }
  let(:candidate_mailer_spy) { spy Mailers::CandidateMailer }

  let(:subject) do

      hiring_repo_spy: hiring_repo_spy,
      candidate_mailer: candidate_mailer_spy,
    )
  end

  context 'when company has automatic approve hiring' do
    let(:company) { build_stubbed(:company, automatic_approve_hiring: true) }
    let(:company_package) { build_stubbed(:company_package, type: CompanyPackage.type.monthly) }

      subject.create(params, company)

      expect(candidate_mailer).not_to have_received(:send_hired_mail)
    end
  end
end
```

> Rspec allows you can use any test double (or partial double) as a spy, but the double must be setup to spy on the messages you care about. Spies automatically spy on all messages. With spies we don't break the Arrange Act Assert pattern that sometimes we don't follow with RSspec. You can read more about RSpec spies [here](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/docs/basics/spies).
>
> If your manager/service needs the return of some dependency, you can stub the return value of a spy just like this: `hiring_repo_spy.stub(:find_hired_candidates_ids) { [123, 321] }`
>
> In addition, we are using Dependency Injection to be able to inject the spies and assert on them easily.

A point about performance: sometimes we want to use Factories to faster, and more reliably, build our data. Whenever possible, use stubbed methods such as `FactoryBot.build_stubbed`. Methods like `FactoryBot.create` update the test database, which is very useful in integration tests but is also a very expensive operation; in scale, hitting the database in manager layer considerably slows down the test pipeline. If the manager or service is not supposed to directly access an ActiveRecord, avoid using create methods.

### üö´ Validator layer

The validator layer is responsible to check the data that is been passed to the database.
Here we want to assert whether the validator is setting the errors properly according to the parameters validation rules.

Always cover all edge cases for possible types as this can avoid a lot of validation problems, which won't be necessarily tested in outer layers.

```ruby
describe Validators::Candidate::CandidateUpdateValidator, type: :validator do
  let(:errors) { subject.errors }

  subject { Validators::Candidate::CandidateUpdateValidator.new params, :update }

  describe 'validates presence' do
    before do
      subject.valid?
    end

    context 'when params are invalid' do
      let(:params) { {} }

      it 'adds :blank error to all missing required fields' do
        expect(errors).to be_added :name, :blank
        expect(errors).to be_added :email, :blank
      end

      it 'adds :inclusion error to available field' do
        expect(errors).to be_added :available, :inclusion
      end
    end

    context 'when params are valid' do
      let(:params) do
        {
          name: 'John Doe',
          email: 'john@doe.com',
          available: available
        }
      end

      context 'and available has "true" value' do
        let(:available) { true }

        it 'has no errors' do
          expect(errors).to be_empty
        end
      end

      context 'and available has "false" value' do
        let(:available) { false }

        it 'has no errors' do
          expect(errors).to be_empty
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### üíæ Repository Layer

Last but not least we have the Repository Layer, responsible for communicating with the database.

In this layer we are looking for integration tests such as in the Entrypoint layer, because we want to truly communicate with the database.

Let's assume that we want to update the status of all the hirings that came from a specify job. To do that first we need to find all the hirings that we want to update.

```ruby
describe Repositories::Hirings::Finder, '#find_all_by_job_id', type: %i[repository hiring] do
  subject { described_class.new Hiring }

  let(:job_to_find_hirings) { create(:job) }
  let(:other_job) { create(:job) }

  context 'when exist hirings for given job' do
    let!(:hiring_to_return_1) { create(:hiring, job: job_to_find_hirings) }
    let!(:hiring_to_return_2) { create(:hiring, job: job_to_find_hirings) }
    let!(:hiring_not_to_return) { create(:hiring, job: other_job) }

    it 'returns an array containing all the hirings for the given job' do
      result = subject.find_all_by_job_id(job_to_find_hirings.id)

      expect(result).to contain_exactly(hiring_to_return_1, hiring_to_return_2)
    end
  end

  context 'when does not exist hirings for given job' do
    let!(:hiring_not_to_return) { create(:hiring, job: other_job) }

    it 'returns an empty array' do
      result = subject.find_all_by_job_id(job_to_find_hirings.id)

      expect(result).to be_empty
    end
  end
end
```

## In practice: React

First of all, everything that was said about the concepts and strategies also apply in the front-end. The only difference is the library that we will use.

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) to help us with the testing.

### Atomic Design

Here at GeekHunter we use the Atomic Design pattern to structure our components. In a nutshell, Atomic Design is composed by 5 layers:

- Pages: specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.
- Templates: page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design‚Äôs underlying content structure.
- Organisms: complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms, for example, a header.
- Molecules: relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, a search input, and a button can be put together in order to create a search form molecule.
- Atoms: blocks that implement all our user interfaces, such as labels, inputs, buttons and so on. Preferably an atom does not have any logic inside, but in some cases, we can add a little bit of logic (e.g. button variants depending on the input propos)

> If you want to learn more about Atomic Design we encourage you to check out this
> [article](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/)

Just as Atomic Design splits components and have different approaches for each one, we tend to do the same when talking about tests.

### ‚öõÔ∏è Atoms

An atom should be a stylized html tag and just that; the smallest part of an organism without any kind of logic. In other words, we need to validate that it is just rendering the content and styles correctly.

For that propose, the Snapshot tests comes in handy. They are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

For example, how can we test a button atom that has different styles (variants)?.

Without Snapshot, it would go something like this:

```typescript
it("renders correctly button props as solid", () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<Button variant="outline">Test</Button>);

  expect(getByTestId("button")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(getByTestId("button")).toHaveStyle("background-color: transparent");
});
```

Not so much elegant, right?

With Snapshot testing, we can test all the content and styles rendering with just two lines of code:

```typescript
it("renders correctly button props as solid", () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<Button variant="solid">Test</Button>).toJSON();

  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

With Snapshot we are testing all passed properties, and if any property changes, the test will inform us. Since we use a third-party component library (Chakra UI), there is no need to test property rendering, as all components are already tested before they are released.

### ‚öõÔ∏è‚õìÔ∏è Molecules

When talking about molecules we tend to go with two different kinds of tests: Snapshots and Integration ones.

**Testing Snapshots? Again? Yes, but different.**

It may seem strange to use snapshot tests again on molecules if the molecules are made of atoms already tested with this tool, but the purpose here is different.

With atoms we want to test if the style of the components, classes and attributes are correct.

With molecules, made up exclusively of atoms, we don't need to revalidate the styles, classes and attributes, we just need to know if the molecule is correctly calling its atoms. If one component is changed when atoms are created/deleted/modified, the snapshot will indicate this change. Therefore, testing this structure alone can be done using shallow rendering.

To exemplify, here we have the two types of snapshots, one generated in full/normal mode and another in shallow mode:

**Normal rendering snapshot**

```typescript
exports[`When page loads render correctly 1`] = `
<div>
  <p
    class="chakra-text css-okg250"
    style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;"
  />
</div>
`;
```

**Shallow rendering snapshot**

```typescript
exports[`When page loads render correctly 1`] = `
<Text
  cursor="pointer"
  fontFamily="body"
  fontSize="xs"
  height={12}
  letterSpacing="1.2px"
  px={8}
  py={1}
  style={
    Object {
      "alignItems": "center",
      "display": "flex",
      "justifyContent": "space-between",
    }
  }
/>
`;
```

Notice that in the shallow mode we don't have native html elements, but the components atoms itself (in this case a component named Text). So, as said, if we remove or add a new atom, the snapshot will tell us.

You may wonder if this kind of test isn't a little bit redundant as we are also relying on Typescript to catch typing issues statically. In some degree, yes, if an atom changes its signature (a new prop, a different type, etc), the transpilation process to Javascript should fail. In our experience though, we see value to have at least one shallow snapshot in each molecule while also enforcing Typescript and Estlint checks.

**Now, the Integration Test**

We know that the molecule is unchanged and is calling its atoms correctly, now we need to see if this set of atoms is actually working as we expect, literally to test its integration. With this we test the purpose of that component with jest, for example:

```typescript
...
...
...

const field = getByTestId('masked-input');

fireEvent.focus(field);
expect(field).toHaveValue('https://www.linkedin.com/in/');

fireEvent.change(field, {
  target: { value: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe' },
});
expect(field).toHaveValue('https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe');

fireEvent.emptied(field);
expect(field).toHaveValue('https://www.linkedin.com/in/');

...
...
...
```

Testing behavior. Does this remind you of something? ü§î.

Yes, we can apply all that we learn from TDD at Rails environment while testing components in React. We can write the tests asserting the behavior that we expect to have at the end before actually implement it.

That's awesome, isn't it? üî•

### üß´ Organism

For organisms we decided to keep using snapshots, because we saw in snapshots an easier way to get any layout break.
Doing only integration tests we won't cover the cases when a style prop like margin or padding, passed down to a child component, has changed.

**Snapshots**

We are keeping the snapshots, but we can't always use shallow snapshots here.
If we need a mocked provider or if we have to mock a mutation from Apollo for our form submit, for instance, the shallow render will break. In this case we will use a standard render, like this:

```typescript
const { container } = render(<RegisterStepLinkedin />);
expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
```

The rule of thumb is always goes for a shallow render in organisms snapshots, if you can't do it, then use the standard way.

> Yes, if we are using standard render, when a child component snapshot breaks, it will also break the organism snapshot. This is a drawback we are fine with.

**Integration**

If the organism doesn't have a form to submit, then we do the same way as we did with the molecules integration tests, but to be able to do the integration tests using React Testing Library and React Hook Form, we needed to make some changes:

1. We needed a `form` tag, so we updated our `FormContainer` component to a form

```typescript
export const FormContainer = ({
  children,
  ...props
}: PropsWithChildren): ReactElement => (
  <Box
    as='form'
    bgColor='background.700'
...
```

2. We needed the FormContainer to have the `onSubmit` function, for instance:
   `<FormContainer onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>`

3. We needed the form submit button to have a `type='submit'`
4. In order to find the inputs using the react testing library we needed to add an `aria-label` to them. For the inputs the value of the `aria-label` should be the same as the input label and for the buttons it should be the same as the button text. Doing it this way we keep the aria-label accessibility purpose too.

With all of this checked we can create our integration tests.

> It's worth to remember that we should test every scenario in the form: warnings messages, errors message, field validation (we already have yup validation to tell us the cases we need to test!!)

### Best practices for integration tests with React Hook Form

- Use `userEvent` to simulate user typing, clicks and etc
- To find the inputs use `screen.getByRole`
- To find other elements in the DOM (like errors messages) use `screen.getByText`
- To test the errors messages that should be displayed, if it's always the same message we can use `findAllByRole('alert')` e validate the number of errors expected, but if there are multiple error messages (different yup validations) for a field we should create a test for each one and validate de error text using `screen.getByText`.

```typescript
const alert = await screen.findAllByRole("alert");
expect(alert).toHaveLength(2);

const error = screen.getByText(/Invalid URL/i);
expect(error).toBeInTheDocument();
```

In the example above we should have 2 alerts in the DOM one is a warning message with always the same text and the other one is the linkedin validation error for a invalid URL.
We could also have another validation error message when the linkedin field is empty, which we should check for in another test.

To test the form submit we should use `toHaveBeenCalledWith` with the values we filled the inputs with.

```typescript
waitFor(() => {
  expect(mockMutate).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    variables: {
      searchStatus: "searching_for_a_job_right_now",
      linkedInUrl: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
      acceptLinkedinImport: undefined,
    },
  });
});
```

### ü™Ñ Utils, hooks, shared...

We have no secrets around here, do we? Hooks, utils, or shared functions are usually simple functions with one or a few input values and one or a few output values, and all you need to do is unit test to see if the internal processing of that data is working as it should

In theory, hooks, utils, and shared functions are fractions of code that we extract and separate so they can be reused in other parts of the application without code redundancy, like this simple sum function:

```typescript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Which can be tested like this:

```typescript
const result = sum(1, 2);
expect(result).to.equal(3);
```

Regardless of the complexity of the tests, the idea will always be the same, passing the expected values on the input should test the expected value on the output.
