# üßë‚Äçüíª  Software Development Analyst

A software development analyst usually has one purpose at GeekHunter: to solve problems (mostly) using technology and to use their skills to help our collaborators
and users in their daily routine.

Thus, a software development analyst is usually assigned into a squad (with a well defined purpose) and is responsible for value delivery in ou product.

It's not expected that a software development analyst will work "alone", but that can happen in extreme cases - so autonomy and self management are important skills. Usually,
this person will be working in a squad with 2 ~ 3 other developers, data scientists, product designers, etc.


# Expectations

What do we expect from a software development analyst at GeekHunter?


## üê£ Junior Software Development Analyst

### Experience

- **Usually goes with the current hype.** Always wants to try out new frameworks or languages but doesn't know how to balance this with the daily routine. Usually, this ends up hurting the productivity for himself or the team.
- Knows at least a bit about software development (a few months to one year), preferably in production environments. Has already worked in new features, bugfixes, etc.
- Knows at least a bit about agile culture, has a slight idea of what are key terms such as Scrum or Kanban
- Does not review code for other collaborators. Usually finds it difficult to analyze external code and find problems in it.
- Asks for help whenever they are feeling blocked, not productive or doesn't know what to do.
- Usually codes "by example" (e.g. copying code), **does not understand how that code works**.
- Requires more attention, since usually gets blocked often.
- Is not proactive with new tasks. Usually needs someone else to tell them what to do.

### Hard Skills

- **Knows at least a bit of the tech stack that we use** (Ruby on Rails, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Python, GraphQL and others). Will eventually have blocks and doubts on how to develop with those technologies.
- Knows at least a bit about automated tests, and at least understands their importance. Is capable of writing a test with the help of another developer.
- Usually can't do TDD daily, but knows what it is.
- Knows at least about git, but can't follow processes such as gitflow.
- Doesn't know much about database technologies, and usually has a hard time to write a SQL query.
- Knows about Object Oriented Programming, but has difficulty implementing it daily.
- Usually **doesn't know much about software architecture**. Has a had time following our current pattern (e.g. clean or hexagonal architecture).
- Doesn't know how to design an application according to its needs (a monolith, micro-services, serveless, etc). **Usually tries to implement a complex model where it's not needed and ends up hurting productivity**.
- **Doesn't know how to debug code**. Usually has a difficult time trying to understand why something doesn't work.

### Soft Skills

- Is able to keep their presence in synchronous (e.g. squad rituals such as dailies, plannings, reviews; pair programmings) and asynchronous moments (e.g. discussions on Slack or Basecamp).
- Is really motivated to learn more and develop their skills.
- Usually doesn't understand their own strong or weak points, or how to proceed in their career. Needs an active leadership helping them to progress.

## üê§ Software Development Analyst

### Experience

- **Adds value to the team**. Is capable of delivering their work efficiently, without being blocked too often.
- Has development experience in production software. This includes creating new features, fixing bugs (sometimes urgently üßØüî•), refactoring code, etc.
- Has experience with Agile Culture. **Has already worked in agile teams using methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, ShapeUp or others**. Knows what is continuous improvement and acts accordingly.
- **Often reviews other people's codes via a code review process**. Is capable of pointing out problems or improvements.
- Asks for help whenever they are feeling blocked, not productive or doesn't know what to do.
- Usually codes "by example" (e.g. copying code), **but knows what they are doing and is usually capable of learning on the fly**.
- Knows a bit about continuous delivery and why that's important, but **often creates large PRs or pieces of code that are hard to review and ship efficiently**.
- Is proactive about starting new tasks. Usually does not need someone else to tell them what to do, as long as there are tasks that conform to our DoR (Definition of Ready).

### Hard Skills

- **Is experienced in most part of the tech stack that we use** (Ruby on Rails, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Python, GraphQL and others). May have occasional blocks, but is able to develop efficiently.
- **Is capable of using TDD daily, and understands the importance of it**.
- Has experience with common database technologies. Knows what are relational models, tables, views, indices, and other terms. Is capable of writing a performant SQL query.
- Has experience in git, **is able to deal with merge conflicts**.
- Is fluent in Object Oriented Programming, knows the key points to it and is able to produce high-quality OOP code.
- Knows what is Functional Programming, knows advantages and disadvantages to each paradigm.
- Understands concepts such as data immutability, pure functions, reactivity.
- **Understands concepts about software architecture, and knows how to follow common patterns** such as Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture and others. Knows about their advantages and disadvantages.
- Understands how to design applications and is capable of choosing a good design according to the complexity or challenge (e.g. monoliths, micro-services, serveless, etc).
- **Knows how to debug code**. Is capable of debugging their own code, manipulating the memory and instructions to reproduce a specific context.
- Usually is capable of debugging external code (such as a dependency). For example, is capable of creating a fork + pull request in a dependency in case something does not work.
- Is capable of solving any problem that doesn't need R&D (Research & Development) efficiently.
