# 🚀 Career Documentation

Have you ever wondered about what your company expects of you? How to move up in your career there?

> Writer's note: well, me too. In fact, all the time! 🤔

This repository is meant to make the whole process of how we handle careers at GeekHunter transparent and public.

# 😎 It's All About People

At GeekHunter, we focus our efforts to create a people-based culture.

Every collaborator goes through a process that we call `Ciclo de Gente`, which is a framework to develop and progress your career and skills. At its core, we rely on
1:1s (at every two weeks, or monthly) to determine what your next steps in your career are and how we'll work towards them.

In every cycle - which takes about 6 months -, you'll determine goals and have a mentor to help you reach them. Some people may choose to develop soft skills, other
people will develop hard skills. What counts is that you'll be working on something that really makes sense to you and will help your career, as an unique individual.
